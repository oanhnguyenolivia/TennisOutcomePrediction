<h1>Predicting the Outcomes of Tennis Matches</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project aims to predict the outcomes of tennis matches using various rating systems and machine learning models. The primary goal is to explore and compare different approaches for their effectiveness in predicting match winners. The models implemented include Naive, Logistic Regression, Elo, Glicko and TrueSkill model. The project involves training these models on historical match data and evaluating their performance on test data.
<br />

<h2>Models Implemented</h2>
Naive Model: A baseline model that predicts outcomes based on simple heuristics or assumptions without sophisticated learning. <br />
Logistic Regression: A machine learning model that predicts match outcomes by learning a linear relationship between player features and the probability of winning.<br />
Elo Rating System: A widely-used rating system that updates player ratings based on match outcomes. The difference in player ratings is used to predict the probability of winning.<br />
Glicko Rating System: An extension of the Elo system that includes a measure of rating reliability (RD), which adjusts based on match frequency and outcomes.<br />
TrueSkill: Developed by Microsoft, this system is used for ranking players in games. It models player skills as a Gaussian distribution and updates based on match outcomes.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
This project demonstrates the application of various rating systems and machine learning models to predict tennis match outcomes. By comparing the performance of Elo, Glicko, TrueSkill, Naive, and Logistic Regression models, it provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. The results can guide future improvements in predictive modeling for sports outcomes.
